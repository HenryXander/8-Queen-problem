This project involves an agent designed to solve the classic 8-Queens problem using local search algorithms.
The agent employs techniques such as Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing, which introduces randomness to escape local optima, and the Min-Conflicts heuristic, which is a local search algorithm for CSP's.
These algorithms enable the agent to efficiently find a solution by exploring the state space while handling the problem's constraints.
